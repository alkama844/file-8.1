Use a signaling server (Node.js + Express + Socket.IO).

Add STUN (Google STUN server) and TURN (coturn or managed TURN) for NAT traversal.

Must be low latency (like WhatsApp/Instagram calls). No noticeable delay.

Audio only (no video). Optimize for speech with Opus codec, mono channel, 24â€“32 kbps.

Must support two users in a private room (1-to-1 call).

Calls should work across devices and browsers (desktop + mobile).

Users should be able to start call, accept, hang up.

Use HTTPS/WSS for signaling.
